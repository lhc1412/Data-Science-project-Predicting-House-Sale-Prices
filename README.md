# Predicting House Sale Prices

In this project, I will build machine learning modeles to predict the house sales prices and use techniques like Feature Engineering, Feature selection and K-Flod to improve the models I built.

I will work with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. There are more information about why the data was collected [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627). Details regarding the different columns in the data can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/307/data_description.txt).

## Summary of results:

I built a model which can be used to predict the house sale prices. Then I used several Feature Engineering techniques, Feature selection techniques and k parameter to set up a pipeline of functions that will let us quickly iterate on different models. __The RMES vaule has been decreased from 57088 at the beginning to 28976__.
